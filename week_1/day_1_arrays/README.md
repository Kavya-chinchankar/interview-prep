# Sony Interview Preparation – DSA + System Design

This repository is a **structured Sony interview preparation roadmap**, combining **Data Structures & Algorithms**, **problem-solving explanations**, and **system design concepts**.

It is designed to reflect how **Sony interviewers evaluate candidates**:

* Clear thinking
* Optimal solutions
* Strong fundamentals
* Ability to explain decisions

---

## 🎯 Who This Repository Is For

* Software Engineer (SDE) candidates targeting **Sony India**
* Backend / Platform Engineer roles
* M.Tech / B.Tech students preparing for **product-based companies**
* Candidates who want **GitHub-visible, interview-relevant work**

---

## 📌 Preparation Philosophy

Sony interviews focus less on memorization and more on:

* **Why** a solution works
* **Trade-offs** in time and space
* **Edge-case handling**
* **Scalability thinking** (even for simple problems)

Every folder in this repository follows this philosophy.

## 🧠 What Each Section Contains

### 📅 Weekly Structure

Each week focuses on **one core theme**:

* Arrays & Strings
* Hashing & Sliding Window
* Recursion & Backtracking
* Trees & Graphs
* System Design Fundamentals

Each **day** contains:

* Interview-style problem statements
* Optimized solutions (Python + JavaScript)
* Explanation-focused README
* Common Sony follow-up questions

---

## 🛠 Languages Used

* Python (clarity + interviews)
* JavaScript (frontend + full-stack relevance)
* Markdown (design explanations)

---

## 📈 Progress Tracking

Daily progress is tracked in `progress.md`.

Example:

```
Day 1: Arrays, Kadane’s Algorithm, Move Zeros, Rate Limiting – Completed
```

This helps:

* Maintain consistency
* Show discipline to recruiters
* Avoid preparation gaps

---

## 🧪 System Design Coverage

Alongside DSA, this repo includes **mini system-design concepts**, such as:

* Rate Limiting
* Authentication systems
* API design basics
* Scalability and caching concepts

Designs are:

* Interview-oriented
* Explanation-first
* Tool-agnostic

---

## ✅ How to Use This Repository Effectively

1. Pick one day
2. Read the problem statement
3. Try solving it yourself
4. Compare with the provided solution
5. Practice explaining your approach out loud

**Rule:** One day = one meaningful GitHub commit

---

## 🏁 Final Note

This repository is intentionally **minimal and focused**.

Sony interviewers value:

> *Clarity over cleverness, fundamentals over tricks.*

Consistency and explanation quality matter more than the number of problems solved.

---

## 🚀 Next Planned Topics

* Prefix Sum & Sliding Window
* Hash Maps & Frequency Counting
* Stack & Queue patterns
* Core System Design questions
